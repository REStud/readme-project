***The Political Economy of Science, Religion, and Growth***

**By Roland Bénabou, Davide Ticchi, Andrea Vindigni**

**Review of Economic Studies, 2021**

**[Overview]{.underline}**

The folder \"Datafortheweb\" contains the data and program files
required to replicate the tables and figures reported in the main text
and in the Online Appendix F of the paper. We here below report a brief
description of each folder and its contents. Then, we provide the Data
Availability and Provenance Statements containing a description of the
origin, location and accessibility of the data used in the article. It
follows a description of the contents of the data and program files.
Online Data Appendix G complements the information provided in this
README file with a detailed description for each variable used in the
empirical analysis and the data source. Program files also contain
additional comments.

**Folder content:**

-   \"**Data**\": the folder is divided into 3 subfolders.

(a) \"**Source**\": it includes all the datasets recalled by the do
    > files and required to replicate the analysis. The subfolder in
    > turn contains two subfolders named:

> \- \"**ICC**\", which includes the datasets used to generate the
> variables of the international cross-country analysis;
>
> \- \"**USA**\", which includes the datasets employed to generate the
> variables of the US cross-state analysis.

(b) \"**Temp**\": empty folder that will include all the datasets
    > generated by and recalled by the do files to construct the two
    > final datasets used to replicate the analysis.

(c) \"**Final**\": empty folder that will include the two datasets (one
    > for the international cross-country analysis and one for the US
    > cross-state analysis) generated by the do files and required to
    > replicate the tables and the figures.

-   \"**Programs**\": includes all the Stata do files required to
    replicate the results.

-   \"**Results**\": empty folder that works as a repository for the
    Tables and Figures.

**Instructions**:

Programs have been written using Stata 14.

**Preliminary set-up before running the programs:**

Install the following accessory user-written commands (in Stata, type
command *ssc install* followed by):

> *estout*
>
> *coefplot*

**Replication**:

\(i) Open the file \"master.do\" and replace the path to the folder
\".../Datafortheweb/\" at line 18 with your own directory path.

\(ii) The output Tables and Figures created by the do files are stored in
the folder \"**Results**\".

The approximate time needed to reproduce the analyses on a standard
desktop machine is less than 5 minutes.

**[Data Availability and Provenance Statements]{.underline}**

All data used in this paper are publicly available. As specified below
in detail, all datasets necessary to replicate our analysis are
contained in the folder \"/Data/Source\", either in the subfolder
\"ICC\" or \"USA\". However, some of the data are reported in the form
of an "extract" of the full dataset, i.e. the datafile provided contains
only the data of the variables of the full dataset used in the paper.
Specifically, this is the case for the European Values Study and the
World Values Survey datasets that are subject to a redistribution
restriction. However, EVS and WVS have both allowed the authors of the
paper to upload an extract of their full datasets. As reported in detail
below, regarding all other data employed in the analysis, the full
dataset is provided either because this is allowed by the conditions of
use or because the authors have been authorized by the owners of the
data to redistribute the dataset within the replication package. The
full Pew Forum on Religion & Public Life 2007 datafiles are provided in
Stata format rather than in the SPSS format that is the one available in
the PEW website.

our elaboration and the data are taken from Table 2, at page 8, of the
report cited above (the Educational Attainment for the Population Aged
25 and Over by Region, State, and Nativity Status: 2007) and contained
in the file \"p20-560.pdf\".

\"Tab III.D11.xls\": Dataset taken from the Bureau of Economic Analysis,
State or DC, from which we take the Foreign Direct Investment in the
United States (FDIUS) in 2006 (Table III.D11. Gross Property, Plant, and
Equipment of Affiliates, State by Use, in millions of dollars).

\"Per capita real GDP by state 2006 2007.xls\": Dataset taken from the
Bureau of Economic Analysis, State or DC, from which we take the
(SAGDP10N) Per capita real GDP by State (Chained 2012 dollars) in 2007.

**Description of the datasets in the subfolder \"Data/Final\"**

The subfolder \"Final\" will contain the following two final datasets

datasets used to replicate the analysis. The datasets contained in this
folder are of no use and can be deleted after the final datasets have
been generated.

**[Description of programs/code files: folder
\"Programs\"]{.underline}**

We here report a brief description of the do files contained in the
folder \"Programs\". The do files also contain some comments inside that
help explaining the various steps.

The file \"master.do\" is the master file. It calls the other do files
(whose brief description of is reported below) to generate the datasets
and replicate the results of the analysis.

STEP 1: BUILDING THE DATASET FOR THE INTERNATIONAL CROSS-COUNTRY
ANALYSIS

Do files numbered from 1 to 14 are used to generate the final dataset
\"icc\_final\_dataset.dta\" for the international cross-country
analysis.

1\_wvs.do: the code generates the five variables of religiosity
(Religious person, Belief in God, Church attendance, Importance of
religion, God very important), the four variables for the shares of
religions (Protestant, Catholic, Muslim, Orthodox) and the correspondent
predominant religions for all countries using the datafile named
