First version: August 2019. This version: June 24, 2020.

This Matlab code replicates the results in all the Tables and Figures in
Qu and Zhuo: \"**Likelihood Ratio Based Tests for Markov Regime
Switching.**\" All folders and subfolders must be added to Matlab path
for all the scripts to work.

The files are organized by tables and figures. For example, the folder
\'Table\_1\' contains scripts that can be used to reproduce the results
in Table 1 of the paper. Similarly, the folder \'Figure\_1\' contains
scripts that can be used to reproduce Figure 1 of the paper. The scripts
in different folders run independently.

Inside each folder, there is a readme file that explains the functions
of the scripts and how they can be executed. The relevant output files
are enclosed to allow a direct comparison with the results reported in
the paper. The computational time is also given when it is not trivial.

The directory \'General\' contains Matlab functions that support the
replication scripts in these folders. It must be added to Matlab path
for other scripts to work.

Some figures are plotted using R by loading the output from Matlab.

The codes have been tested on Matlab version 2017b and R version 3.6.1.

The following Packages or toolboxes are needed. For Matlab: Parallel
Computing Toolbox. For R: R.matlab.
