READ ME to replicate results from "Vintage-specific Driving Restrictions"

All results were obtained using Stata15_MP and Matlab_R2017b. 

Instructions:
1. Open "run_stata.do" and change $path to local directory
2. run "run_stata.do" using Stata
3. run "run_matlab.m" using Matlab

Output:
All figures should be saved in the folder "figures", while all tables in the folder "tables".


Note: The model estimation and simulations were done using Sherlock HPC cluster from Stanford Univeristy. The corresponding codes are commented in "run_matlab.m" and figures can still be replicated without running the whole code again. To run the estimation and simulations again you need to uncomment lines 21, 49-51, and 78-80 of "run_matlab.m." Running everything again can take a few weeks. Parallel computing is highly recommended.
