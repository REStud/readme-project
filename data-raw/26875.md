# README

## Overview

The code in this replication package constructs Figure 5 using MATLAB.
The replicator should expect the code to run for about 100 seconds.

## Data Availability and Provenance Statements

- [x] This paper does not involve analysis of external data (i.e., no data are used or the only data are generated by the authors via simulation in their code).

## Computational requirements

### Software Requirements

- Matlab (code was run with Matlab Release 2022a)
- Any OS supporting Matlab 2022a (code was run with macOS 12.4)

### Memory and Runtime Requirements

#### Summary

Approximate time needed to reproduce the analyses on a standard 2022 desktop machine:

- [x] <10 minutes
- [ ] 10-60 minutes
- [ ] 1-8 hours
- [ ] 8-24 hours
- [ ] 1-3 days
- [ ] 3-14 days
- [ ] > 14 days
- [ ] Not feasible to run on a desktop machine, as described below.

#### Details

The code was last run on a **10-core Apple Silicon-based laptop with 64GB of RAM and macOS version 12.4**. 

## Description of programs/code

- The functions in files named `profits_*.m` perform computations necessary to determine the different colored regions in Figure 5
- The main program `replicate_Fig5.m` generates a file `Figure5.png` corresponding to Figure 5 of the paper (except for labeling). Labeling was done by authors directly in the LaTeX code.

## Instructions to Replicators

- Open the replication archive in Matlab and run `replicate_Fig5.m`

## List of tables and programs

The provided code reproduces:

- [ ] All numbers provided in text in the paper
- [ ] All tables and figures in the paper
- [x] Selected tables and figures in the paper, as explained and justified below.
