\
OVERVIEW\
The code in this replication package uses data from four experiments, all of which are included here.\
Five Stata do files are provided: one for each study plus one master file. The master file runs all the others in order, which can be run separately as well.\
\
DATA AVAILABILITY STATEMENT\
The data used in this replication package is publicly available here as part of the package. All data were collected from experiments conducted by the authors for this study.\
\
SOFTWARE/HARDWARE REQUIREMENTS\
The analyses included here were conducted in Stata (SE) v17.0 using a MacBook Pro (2021 - macOS Monterey v12.5). Runtime was negligible (< 5 minutes).\

CONTENTS\
*** .do Files ***\
There are five do files. Each study has a corresponding do file, and there is a master do file which runs the other four in order.\
	Study1.do reproduces:\
		Regression output in Section 4.1.2\
		Figure 1(a)\
		Figure 1(b)\
		Appendix Table 1\
	Study2.do reproduces:\
		Regression output in Section 4.2.2\
		Table 1\
		Appendix Table 2\
		Figure 2(a)\
		Figure 2(b)\
	Study3.do reproduces:\
		Table 2\
		Appendix Table 3\
		Regression output in Section 5.1.2\
		Figure 3\
	Study4.do reproduces:\
		Regression output in Section 5.2.2\
		Figure 4\
*** Data Files ***\
There are five data files in .csv format. Each study has a corresponding data file except Study 2, which contains two data files (the first file is used to produce everything in that do file except Figure 2(a) and Figure 2(b).\
*** Output ***\
This folder contains the figures created in the do files.}
