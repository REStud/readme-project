Description of Data

This diskette contains data from the 1982 benchmark input-output
(I-O) accounts as published in "Input-Output Accounts of the U.S.
Economy, 1982", SURVEY OF CURRENT BUSINESS 71 (July 1991).  The
SURVEY is available at a cost of $6.50 domestic and $8.13 foreign
from the Superintendent of Documents, U.S. Government Printing
Office, Washington, DC 20402.

Data are included on this diskette for interindustry transactions
(industry inputs and outputs), associated trade and
transportation costs (margins), and related information from the
1982 input-output study at the summary (85-industry) level.  The
related information includes direct requirements coefficients and
two sets of total requirements coefficients.

The trade and transportation costs are the margins associated
with each allocation of a commodity to a using industry or to a
final demand component.  This configuration provides more
detailed margin information than the published data, in which the
margin entries have been summed by column to obtain total trade
and total transportation costs for each consuming industry and
final demand component.  When applicable, the trade margin
contains the various sales, excise, and other taxes imposed on
retail and wholesale transactions.

The mathematical derivation of the various matrices discussed in
the 1982 benchmark accounts article is described in "Mathematical
Derivation of the Total Requirements Tables for the Input-Output
Study" found in the file MATHIO.TXT.

Data for earlier benchmark years are not revised when the current
benchmark I-O accounts data become available.  Significant
changes in methodology, coverage of data, and data definitions
are noted in the SURVEY article describing the 1982 benchmark I-O
accounts.

Description of Files

Data files are fixed format ASCII files.  Dollar values represent
100,000's of dollars at producers' prices.  Coefficients are
shown to seven places.  However, decimal points do not appear
explicitly in the file.  A negative value is indicated by a minus
sign.

No copyrighted data appears in these files.
