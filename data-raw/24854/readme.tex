\section{Overview}

This replication package contains the data and code required to reproduce all the tables, figures, and other numbers reported in the paper (including in online appendices). In addition, it contains instructions on how to access and clean the raw data.

\section{Data availability and provenance statements} \label{sec:DAS}

We collected data from a variety of sources, described below. All the data are publicly available. This section describes how to access the documents and raw data used to construct the datafiles needed to run the programs.

\subsection{Data collected from public documents}

\begin{enumerate}[(1)]
\item \label{s:fees} Data on patent office fees in 2005, 2010, and 2015 were collected from the Office of the Federal Register, Code of Federal Regulations, Title 37: Patents, Trademarks, and Copyright. The source documents can be downloaded from:
\begin{description}
  \item[2005:] \url{https://www.govinfo.gov/content/pkg/CFR-2005-title37-vol1/pdf/CFR-2005-title37-vol1.pdf}
  \item[2010:] \url{https://www.govinfo.gov/content/pkg/CFR-2010-title37-vol1/pdf/CFR-2010-title37-vol1.pdf}
  \item[2015:] \url{https://www.govinfo.gov/content/pkg/CFR-2015-title37-vol1/pdf/CFR-2015-title37-vol1.pdf}
\end{description}

\item \label{s:budget} Data on the cost of operating the patent program in 2005, 2010, and 2015 were collected from the U.S.~Patent and Trademark Office (USPTO). The source documents are the USPTO's Performance and Accountability Reports, which can be downloaded from:
\begin{description}
  \item[2005:] \url{https://www.uspto.gov/sites/default/files/about/stratplan/ar/USPTOFY2005PAR.pdf} (p.~65)
  \item[2010:] \url{https://www.uspto.gov/sites/default/files/about/stratplan/ar/USPTOFY2010PAR.pdf} (p.~57)
  \item[2015:] \url{https://www.uspto.gov/sites/default/files/documents/USPTOFY15PAR.pdf} (p.~38)
\end{description}

\item \label{s:exsal} Data on the average salary of examiners and the number of examiners employed at the USPTO in 2005, 2010, and 2015 were obtained from FederalPay.org, a non-governmental information portal built by federal employees. The information can be obtained by accessing \url{https://www.federalpay.org/employees/occupations/patent-examining/} and selecting the relevant year.

\item \label{s:fc} Data on patent grants broken down by industry were collected from the USPTO's report on ``U.S.~Patenting Trends by NAICS Industry Category.'' Two sets of data were compiled:
\begin{enumerate}[(a)]
  \item patent grants by year of grant, total (any ownership category); source documents available at \url{https://www.uspto.gov/web/offices/ac/ido/oeip/taf/naics/naics_own_fgall/naics_own_fg.htm}
  \item patent grants by year of application assigned to U.S.~corporations; source documents available at \url{https://www.uspto.gov/web/offices/ac/ido/oeip/taf/naics/naics_own_faall/naics_own_fa.htm}
\end{enumerate}

\item \label{s:aipla} Data on the costs of patent litigation were collected from the 2005, 2011, and 2017 editions of the American Intellectual Property Law Association's ``Report of the Economic Survey'' (AIPLA, \citeyear{AIPLA05}; AIPLA, \citeyear{AIPLA11}; AIPLA, \citeyear{AIPLA17}).

\item \label{s:propensity} Data on patent propensity by industry were compiled from \citet{CoNW00}. Based on an extensive survey, \citet{CoNW00} report the sector-specific percentage of innovations for which firms seek patent protection, distinguishing between process and product innovations. In addition, data on the percentage of R\&D time spent on each type of innovation were compiled from \citet{ArK98}.

\item \label{s:mansfield} Data on the percentage of innovations that firms in 12 different industries claim would not have been developed without patent protection were collected from \citet{Ma86}.
\end{enumerate}

\section{Dataset list} \label{sec:datafiles}

This section lists the data files provided as part of the package (in the folder \texttt{Data}) and explains what they contain. If applicable, it explains how the files were constructed from the raw data obtained from the sources described above.

\begin{description}
  \item[\texttt{USPTO_fees.xlsx}:] Contains the data from (\ref{s:fees}), complemented with data from (\ref{s:ptoapps}) used for weighting. The numbers are converted to 2018 dollars using GDP deflator data from (\ref{s:gdpdeflator}).
  \item[\texttt{USPTO_budget.xlsx}:] Contains the data from (\ref{s:budget}) and (\ref{s:exsal}). The numbers are converted to 2018 dollars using GDP deflator data from (\ref{s:gdpdeflator}).
  \item[\texttt{number_of_patents_3and4digits.csv}:] Contains the data from (\ref{s:fc}a).
  \item[\texttt{fractional count.csv}:] Contains the data from (\ref{s:fc}b).
  \item[\texttt{litigation_costs(AIPLA_survey_data).xlsx}]: Contains the data from (\ref{s:aipla}). The numbers are converted to 2018 dollars using GDP deflator data from (\ref{s:gdpdeflator}).
  \item[\texttt{Patent Propensity.csv}:] Contains sector-specific overall patent propensities based on the data from (\ref{s:propensity}). To construct these numbers, we weight the raw patent propensity for process and product innovations from \citet[Table A1, p.~49]{CoNW00} by the percentage of R\&D time spent on each type of innovation, as reported in \citet[Table 1, p.~133]{ArK98}.
  \item[\texttt{mansfield.xlsx}:] Contains the data from (\ref{s:mansfield}), complemented with data from (\ref{s:pa2011}).
  \item[\texttt{naics5811.csv}:] Dataset from (\ref{s:ces}).
  \item[\texttt{capbymeasure_table2.1.csv}:] Table 2.1 from (\ref{s:cap}).
  \item[\texttt{capbymeasure_table4.1.csv}:] Table 4.1 from (\ref{s:cap}).
  \item[\texttt{capbymeasure_table8.1.csv}:] Table 8.1 from (\ref{s:cap}).
  \item[\texttt{ECN_2007_US_31SR12_with_ann.csv}:] Dataset from (\ref{s:conc}).
  \item[\texttt{capacity_utilisation_monthly.txt}:] Dataset from (\ref{s:cumonth}).
  \item[\texttt{capacity_utilisation.csv}:] Dataset from (\ref{s:cu}).
  \item[\texttt{mfp_4digits.csv}:] Contains the MFP data in the worksheet ``Measures by industry'' from the 4-digit NAICS level data from (\ref{s:tfp}).
  \item[\texttt{manual_assign_tfp_estimate.csv}:] Contains manually assigned TFP estimates for a selection of 6-digit NAICS codes.\footnote{Our TFP estimates are residuals of a regression of MFP on growth in capacity utilitization. For cases where this does not yield a positive estimate, we manually assign a value according to the following procedure: if they exist and are positive, use the average of 6-digit estimates for the same 5-digit naics code. Otherwise, use the 3-digit average MFP ($1/20 \times \log(\textit{mfp}_{2007}/\textit{mfp}_{1987})$) from the 3-digit NAICS level data from (\ref{s:tfp}).}
  \item[\texttt{R\&D computations.xlsx}:] Contains the three tables of data from (\ref{s:rd}) in worksheets ``1999-2003'', ``2004'', and ``Constant 2000 dollars''. In addition, it contains the worksheet ``Computations,'' which uses the data in the other worksheets to compute the numbers in the file \texttt{R\&D data.csv} (see below).
  \item[\texttt{R\&D data.csv}:] Contains average R\&D spending over the 1999-2004 period by 3-digit NAICS sector, computed in column Q of worksheet ``Computations'' in \texttt{R\&D computations.xlsx}.

  \item[\texttt{N_f.csv}:] Contains data on average yearly patent applications by technology field over the 1999-2004 period, computed based on the data from (\ref{s:nberpat}). We provide a Stata do file and an excel file to reproduce the numbers in the file from the raw data; see Section \ref{sec:programs}.
  \item[\texttt{mapping rule.csv}:] File from (\ref{s:corrpto}a) containing the correspondence between NAICS codes and the sequence numbers used in the patent count data from (\ref{s:fc}). Each sequence number corresponds to exactly one NAICS code.
  \item[\texttt{naics_co14.csv}:] File from (\ref{s:corrpto}b) containing the correspondence between sequence numbers and technology classes. One sequence number can correspond to multiple technology classes.
  \item[\texttt{classcat.csv}:] File from (\ref{s:corrnber}) containing the correspondence between technology classes and technology fields (the variable `CAT'). Each class corresponds to one technology field but one technology field contains many classes.
  \item[\texttt{old to new naics.csv}:] File used to map the level of NAICS aggregation used by the USPTO to the level we use. Ours is the same as the USPTO aggregation except that sector 325 is separated into just 3254 and others (3251, 3252, 3253, 3255, 3256, and 3259 combined).
  \item[\texttt{GDPDEF.xls}:] Dataset from (\ref{s:gdpdeflator}).

\section{Computational requirements}

\subsection{Software requirements}

\begin{itemize}
\item Stata (code was last run with version 14)
\item Python 3.7.3
  \begin{itemize}
  \item \texttt{numpy} 1.18.1
  \item \texttt{scipy} 1.4.1
  \item \texttt{matplotlib} 3.1.3
  \item \texttt{pandas} 1.0.3
  \item \texttt{itertools}
  \item \texttt{os}
  \item \texttt{sklearn.linear_model}
  \end{itemize}
  The file ``\texttt{/programs/requirements.txt}'' lists these dependencies;
    please run ``\texttt{pip install -r requirements.txt}'' as the
    first step.
\item Microsoft Excel 2016
\end{itemize}

\subsection{System and memory requirements}

The code was last run on a Dell laptop with an Intel 4-core i7-8650U CPU, 16GB of RAM, and with Microsoft Windows 10 Enterprise Version 10.0.19042. Runtime requirements are provided in Section \ref{sec:programs}.

\section{Description of programs} \label{sec:programs}

\begin{itemize}
  \item Stata:
  \begin{itemize}
    \item \texttt{litigation_cost_parameters.do} is a do file that runs the regression using the data from (\ref{s:aipla}) on which the litigation cost parameters ($l_0$ and $l_1$) are based.
    \item \texttt{Computation of N_f.do} is a do file that counts the number of patents assigned to U.S.~corporations, by technology field, in the data from (\ref{s:nberpat}).
  \end{itemize}
  \item Python:
  \begin{itemize}
    \item \texttt{general.py} and \texttt{mod1_fcts.py} define the classes and functions on which the code for parameter assignment and construction of calibration targets relies.
    \item \texttt{parameter_values.py} runs the data analysis and computations that generate (a subset of) the assigned parameters and calibration targets. The output is written to \texttt{params_targets.csv}. Runtime: 1 minute.
    \item \texttt{estimation_and_counterfactuals.py} runs the baseline estimation whose results are in Table 2, Panel A and the counterfactuals which are in Tables 3 and 4. It also runs the external validation tests reported in Section 4.4. All of the output is written to \texttt{baseline_and_counterfactuals.csv}. Runtime: about 60 minutes.
    \item The programs in the \texttt{Robustness} folder (\texttt{robustness_lr238.py}, \texttt{robustness_pakes.py}, and \texttt{robustness_frechet.py}) generate the output for the robustness checks in Table 2, Panel B. Their output is written to homonymous csv files. Runtime: each about 2 minutes.
    \item The programs in the \texttt{Figures} folder (\texttt{figure2.py}, \texttt{figure3.py}, \texttt{figure4.py}, and \texttt{figure5.py}) generate the figures (for both main text and online appendix). The code in these programs relies on the program \texttt{class_definitions.py}, also in the \texttt{Figures} folder, which defines various classes and functions. Runtime: Figure 2 -- about 80 minutes, Figures 3-5 -- less than 1 minute each. Output files: \texttt{W_contours.png} (Figure 2), \texttt{growthrates.png} (Figure 3), \texttt{profitfuncs.png} (Figure 4), \texttt{lambdalow.png} (Figure 5).
  \end{itemize}
  \item Excel:
  \begin{itemize}
    \item \texttt{Tables.xlsx} uses the datafiles and the output generated by the Python code to produce the tables and other numbers reported in the paper.
    \item \texttt{Computation of N_f.xlsx} uses the output generated by the Stata do file \texttt{Computation of N_f.do} to compute the numbers in \texttt{Data/N_f.csv}.
  \end{itemize}
\end{itemize}

\section{Instructions to replicators}

Set up the environment as explained above. Store the data files contained in the replication package (described in Section \ref{sec:datafiles}) in a subfolder \texttt{Data}. Then:
\begin{enumerate}
  \item Run the Stata do files \texttt{litigation_cost_parameters.do} and \texttt{Computation of N_f.do}.
  \item Run the Python program \texttt{parameter_values.py}.
  \item Run the Python program \texttt{estimation_and_counterfactuals.py}.
  \item Run the three Python programs in the subfolder \texttt{Robustness}.
  \item Run the four Python programs in the subfolder \texttt{Figures}.
  \end{enumerate}
The order of execution does not matter. (Although the first two steps serve as inputs for the last three steps, and step 3 serves as input for step 5, the relevant output has been copied to the program files that use them so that each can be run independently.)

Once all the output files have been generated, open \texttt{Tables.xlsx} with Microsoft Excel. In the pop-up window that asks about links, click ``Update'', then click ``Edit links...'' Select all the source files in the list, then click ``Open sources.''

\pagebreak

\section{List of tables and figures}

For all tables and figures, as well as for numbers reported elsewhere in the text, we indicate the program that generates them and the output file to which they are written. In the last column, we indicate in which worksheet of the file \texttt{Tables.xlsx} the relevant exhibit is generated (if applicable).
