Experimental results for Bushong, Rabin, and Schwartzstein.---Software Requirements:
	Stata (analysis completed on version 15)---Datafiles:
	/Data/Vignettes.dta
	/Data/RealEffort.dta---Replication overview:
	All analyses from Section 6 of paper. A copy of the manuscript and the online appendices are included in these replication files.
	Table 1 (see Manuscript) can be replicated using Vignettes.do
	Table 3 (see Manuscript) can be replicated using RealEffort.do
	Table A1 (see Online Appendix) can be replicated using Vignettes.do
	Table A2 (see Online Appendix) can be replicated using RealEffort.do
	
	Stata .do files create Excel outputs named Vignettes_Results.xls and RealEffort_Results.xls. These are also included with this replication package.---Discussion: 	The data files are split by the two experiments---vignettes and real effort---and are named accordingly.The vignettes experiment data lives in the file /Data/Vignettes.dta	The code that runs the analysis of this experiment is well-documented and runs the analyses in the order they are presented in the text. This code is Vignettes.do and lives in the top-level folder. The vignettes experiment data lives in the file /Data/RealEffort.dta	The code that runs the analysis of this experiment is well-documented and runs the analyses in the order they are presented in the text.
