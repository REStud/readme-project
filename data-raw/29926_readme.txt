This zip file contains three folders:

[dm] which is a python3 library by Jan Drugowitsch available at

https://github.com/DrugowitschLab

a bug in the setup file (setup.py) has been fixed.

The library can be installed on any Debian GNU/Linux 10 machine with the following instructions

$ cd dm
$ cd python
$ sudo python3 setup.py build
$ sudo python3 setup.py install

We used Debian GNU/Linux 10.7 (Raspberry Pi Desktop)


[Python_Code_Simulations] which contains the scripts which simulate the Metropolis-DDM algorithm. The names of the files explain what simulation is produced.

For example

Python_Code_Simulation_2_3_1_1.py

produces Simulation 1 of Section 2.3.1.

ALL SCRIPTS run on python3 and need the following libraries:

- numpy
- matplotlib.pyplot
- ddm

the latter is the library contained in folder [dm] (see above).


[Simulations_Outputs] which contains the plots generated by the scripts that we use in the paper.  The names of the files explain to what simulation the plot refers to.

For example

Figure_2_3_1_1.png

is generated by 

Python_Code_Simulation_2_3_1_1.py

producing the plot of Simulation 1 of Section 2.3.1.

This paper does not involve analysis of external data. The code generating all simulations' plots is in this repository.
