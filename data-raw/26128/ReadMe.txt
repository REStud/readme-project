Description of data

  This diskette contains data from the 1992 benchmark input-
  output (I-O)accounts as published in "Benchmark Input-Output
  Accounts for the U.S. Economy, 1992," SURVEY OF CURRENT
  BUSINESS 78  (November 1997).  Copies of the article are
  available from the above address at a cost of $25.

  Methodology, coverage of the data, and data definitions are
  noted in the SURVEY article describing the benchmark I-O.

  Data files containing the tables are comma delimited ASCII
  files consisting of a row I-O code, a column I-O code, a
  table reference number, and the cell value(s).  Values 
  represent millions of dollars at producers' prices or 
  coefficients as specified in the format files (*.fmt)
  associated with each table.  All cells in the tables are 
  included.  No copyrighted data are found in these files.

  The tables containing the 1992 benchmark data (tables 1-7)
  have been compressed into a single self-extracting "zip" 
  file, "TBL-92.exe".  The uncompressed files will use
  approximately 1 megabyte of disk space.
      

Procedure for using disk

  Copy all diskette files to a directory on your hard disk. 
  At the DOS prompt, type TBL-92 to uncompress the files.
  (Windows 95 or NT users should click on Start, then 
  select Run, then type (or browse and select)the directory
  path you created for the diskette data, e.g.; "C:\IOData\
  TBL-92.exe")


  You can convert any of the uncompressed data files to
  spreadsheet format using the program included on this disk
  (SPREAD.EXE).  To convert the tables, move to the directory
  where you have copied the benchmark files and type the
  command SPREAD (or double click on SPREAD.exe in the Windows
  Explorer).  Follow the directions given by the program.
