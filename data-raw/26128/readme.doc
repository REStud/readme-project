Description of data

      This diskette contains data from the 1987 benchmark input-output (I-O)
      accounts as published in "Benchmark Input-Output Accounts for the U.S.
      Economy, 1987," SURVEY OF CURRENT BUSINESS 74  (April 1994).  Copies of
      the article are available from the above address at a cost of $25.

      Methodology, coverage of the data, and data definitions are noted in the
      SURVEY article describing the benchmark I-O.

      Data files containing the tables are fixed format ASCII files consisting
      of a row I-O code, a column I-O code, the table reference number, and
      the cell value(s).  Values represent millions of dollars at producers'
      prices.  All values are right justified with decimals shown explicitly. 
      All cells in the tables are included.  No copyrighted data are found in
      these files.

      The tables containing the 1987 benchmark data (tables 1-9) have been
      compressed.  Approximately 21 megabytes of disk space are required to
      uncompress all the data files.
      

Procedure for using disk

      Copy all diskette files to a directory on your hard disk.  At the DOS
      prompt, type TBL-87 to uncompress the files.


      The I-O tables 1, 2 (includes SURVEY tables 2.1 and 2.2, and
      transportation costs and wholesale and retail trade margins) , 3, 4, and
      5 can be converted to a spreadsheet format file using a program
      contained on this disk (SPREAD.EXE).  To convert the tables, move to the
      directory where you have copied the benchmark files and type the command
      SPREAD.  Follow the directions given by the program.  Tables 6 and 7
      provide, respectively, the column and rows sums for table 2; tables 8
      and 9 provide, respectively, the column sums for tables 4 and 5.
