This file describe the files and calculations used for various data moments in Table 2. 


Table 2 - Top 10-percent income share -- This is the average between 2008 and 2015 of the numbers from the World Inequality Database, available at https://wid.world/country/india/.
Table 2 - Average Establishment Size.xlsx -- calculates average establishment size as the ratio of the total number of workers to the total number of establishments in India. The underlying data is from Tables A.1 and A.2 of the Appendix of the All India Report of Fifth Economic Census. The file Tables_All_India_Report_Of_Fifth_Economic_Census.pdf, which was downloaded from http://www.mospi.gov.in/all-india-report-fifth-economic-census.
Table 2 - External Finance to GDP.xls -- The raw data are the Financial Structures Database, 2010 as described in the 'About' worksheet. We calculate external finance to GDP as the sum of private credit from money banks and other financial institutions, the public bond market, and 35 percent of the public stock market (since we assume the remainder is the fraction that goes to capital gains rather than financing the firm per se). 
Table 2 - Interest rate in India.xlsx - This calculates the real interest rate as the difference between the savings rate and the inflation rate. Savings rates are the most relevant interest rate, but are first available in the 2000s.  We therefore use the average of the years 2000-05 instead of the 1990s.  
Table2IncomeAutoCorrelation.do - This calculate the income autocorrelation using the ICRISAT.dta dataset, which is ICRISAT.dta and outputs the result in the file Table2IndiaIncomeAutoCorrelation.log.

The concentration of firms and exit rate are not from disclosable sources:

Top 10-percentile employment share -- This moment is calculated using micro data from the 2005 Economic Census of India. In particular, we measure employment are hired workers and calculate the share of total hired workers accounted by the top 10% of firms ranked in terms of their number of hired workers.

Establishment exit rate -- 4.72% implied annual rate from 1994-1995 to 2010-2011 in the ASI-NSS combined as calculated using the dataset in Hsieh and Klenow, "The Life Cycle of Plants in India and Mexico," Quarterly Journal of Economics, 129(3): pp 1035-84. The number corresponds to the weighted average of the exit rate by age reported in Figure II and was reported to us by Pete Klenow (personal communication, April 11, 2015).
