Replication Steps:

1. Run in Matlab the code codes/data_1.m. This code takes the raw data and prepares it for the main analysis.

2. Run in Matlab the code codes/main_analysis_2.m. This code implements the main analysis using the output file from Step 1 
and produces all the figures, tables and statistics reported in the paper. All the output will be automatically saved in
the folder output/.

Raw Data (and its sources):

The raw data used in this paper (located in the folder data/raw/) is:
