This file accompanies the replication codes and data uploaded on this
platform for the paper "IQ, Expectations, and Choice" by F. D'Acunto, 
D. Hoang, M. Paloviita, and M. Weber. 

The file "Analysis_Code_to_reproduce_outputs.do" reports the 
coding steps to be performed for the replication of all figures and 
tables in the paper. 

The script is written for usage with the Stata econometric analysis
software. The code has been written under a Stata MP 15 licence, and 
could be used with that version of Stata or any more recent versions.

In order to execute the code, researchers will need to install the 
package "estout", which is not available as a default in Stata MP 15. 
Researchers can find the package's contents and description as well as 
detailed installation instructions at the following link:
http://repec.sowi.unibe.ch/stata/estout/

The code is organized based on each exhibit that appears in the paper, 
starting with Figures (Figure 1 to Figure 6) and proceeding with Tables
(Table 1 to Table 7). For each exhibit, we also label separately the 
coding steps used to produce each subcomponent when the exhibit includes
different panels. 

For each exhibit, the code calls the relevant data set used for the 
analysis. In particular, the whole analysis is based on two original 
data sets:

1. The file "inflation_iq_data_fi_04302018.dta" is a Stata-formatted
   file that includes the observational micro-data used in the paper. 
   The confidentiality level of these data is regulated by the "General 
   Data Protection Regulation (GDPR)" of the European Union and the 
   "Data Protection Act of Finland (Tietosuojalaki)." The data fall 
   under the category of non-anonymised personal data based on the 
   relevant regulatory framework. Moreover, the data include information
   on two of the "special sensitive categories" of information that the 
   relevant regulatory framework deems subject to special grounds of 
   confidentiality (Race, Ethnicity, and Biometric data for ID purposes). 
   As such, based on the relevant regulatory framework, the data cannot 
   be made public under any circumstances and are not uploaded on this 
   platform. 

   Please see the "Data Availability Statement" below for the detailed 
   description of this data set and the steps interested researchers 
   need to perform in order to obtain access to this data set.

2. The file "Your View of the Economy_February 18, 2021_16.53.xlsx" is a
   Microsoft Excel formatted file that includes the experimental micro-data
   used in the paper. The confidentiality and conformity of the collection
   of these data through experimental procedures has been pre-approvdes by the 
   Institutional Review Board (IRB) of Boston College. The experimental protocol
   allows for de-identified information to be shared publicly after masking 
   personally-identifying information, such as the IP addresses of experimental 
   subjects. The data are thus deposited in this platform and can be accessed 
   from here by interested researchers.
