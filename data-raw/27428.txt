“Bilateral Imbalances” Replication ReadMe

Use STATA to run Master_BilatImb.do in its current folder (“Replication”) with all sub-folders unchanged to reproduce the data construction and all figures and analytical results from the paper.

Structure of the .do-file:

SECTION 2

2.1 extracts and formats all data used from the Penn World Tables (PWT)
2.2 extracts and formats all data used from the World Input Output Database (WIOD)

SECTION 3

Merges and formats the PWT and WIOD data to create the main dataset for two periods (1995-99; 2010-14)

SECTION 4

4.1 creates Figures 1 and 2
4.2 creates Figure A.1

SECTION 5

Performs and stores the output of the gravity regressions described in Section 2.1.3

SECTION 6

Performs and stores the output of the full model calibration described in Appendix Section A.6

SECTION 7

7.2 creates Figure 3 and data for Tables 1 and 2
7.3 creates Figure 4 and A.2

SECTION 8

8.2 creates data for Table A.4
8.3 creates data for Table A.5
8.4 creates data for Tables 5
8.5 creates all output for the regressions described in Section 4.3, including Table 6

SECTION 9

9.2 creates all output for the counterfactual described in Section 3.3, including Table 4 and Figure 5
9.3 creates all output for the counterfactual described in footnote 35
9.4 creates all output for the counterfactual described in Appendix Section A.7
9.5 creates all output for the counterfactual described in Section 3.4, including Figure 6 and Figure A.3
9.7 creates all output for the counterfactual described in Section 4.4, including Figures 7 and 8

SECTION 10

Processes the counterfactual output from Section 9 to produce charts in the style of Figures 5 and 8 (among others) for all counterfactuals
