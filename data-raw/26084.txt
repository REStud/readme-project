This package includes the code necessary to replicate results in the paper. There is no external data required.

This readme file is divided in five sections. The first documents data sources used in the paper. The second describes and provides instructions for the programs in the ./MatlabCode folder. The third section describes and provides instructions for the programs in the ./Matlab folder, which should be run last. The fourth section describes the main output files generated by the programs (stored in the ./MatlabCode folder) which are labeled in the order they appear in the paper. The last section contains references.

SUMMARY
=========================================
-- There is no external data used in this paper. No outside data is required to reproduce any of the figures.

SUMMARY
=========================================
The Matlab folder includes programs that simulate the model and produce the figures in the paper. There are four main programs (PlotFigure1.m, PlotFigure2.m, PlotFigure3.m, and PlotFigure4.m) and six subroutine m files
(HellwigEquilA.m, EquilgovFixedRule.m, MasterEquilOptGov3.m, MasterEquilOptGov4.m, EquilGov.m, and EquilGovF.m).

=========================================
SOFTWARE REQUIREMENTS
=========================================
The programs requires only Matlab to reproduce the figures. This code was successfully run on Matlab2020b.

=========================================
HARDWARE REQUIREMENTS
=========================================
This code was run on Matlab2020b and was successfully run on a Dell XPS 15 9500 laptop with an Intel Core I-9 processor.

The programs have moderate run-times, but do not require specialized hardware or a compute cluster. The runtimes for PlotFigure1.m, PlotFigure2.m, PlotFigure3.m, and PlotFigure4.m were .9 seconds, 79.15 minutes, 287.95 minutes, and 167.72 minutes, respectively, on the Dell computer.

=========================================
DATA REQUIREMENTS
=========================================
- These programs do not require any external data.

=========================================
INSTRUCTIONS AND DESCRIPTION OF THE PROGRAMS
=========================================
To simplify the explanation of the code, I will list and describe programs separately according to four main steps. Some programs perform basic functions that are used in multiple steps; I list those files at the end of the section.

The full description of the procedures executed in these programs is provided in the online appendix.

Instructions: Run PlotFigure1, then PlotFigure2, then PlotFigure3, then PlotFigure4.

Description of files: 

- PlotFigure1.m: This file reproduces figure 1. All parameters for the simulation are entered at the beginning of Figure1.m.

- PlotFigure2.m: This file reproduces figure 2 and requires HellwigEquilA.m and EquilgovFixedRule.m as subroutine files. All parameters for the simulation are entered at the beginning of Figure2.m.

- PlotFigure3.m: This file reproduces figure 3 and requires MasterEquilOptGov3.m, HellwigEquilA.m, EquilGov.m, and EquilGovF.m as subroutine files.

- PlotFigure4.m: This file reproduces figure 4 and requires MasterEquilOptGov4.m, HellwigEquilA.m, EquilGov.m, and EquilGovF.m as subroutine files.

=========================================
AUXILIARY FILES USED IN MULTIPLE STEPS
=========================================

- HellwigA.m: This file contains a subroutine that solves for the Hellwig Equilibrium given the parameters in the PlotFigure run files.

- EquilGovFixedRule.m: This file contains another subroutine that solves for the equilibrium with government intervention under a fixed government policy.

- MasterEquilOptGov3.m: This file contains another subroutine that solves for the equilibrium (fundamental-centric or government-centric) under optimal government policy. It uses both EquilGov.m and EquilGovF.m.

- MasterEquilOptGov4.m: This file contains another subroutine that solves for the boundary value of sigma_L upon which the equilibrium transitions from government-centric to government-centric. It uses both EquilGov.m and EquilGovF.m.

- EqilGov.m: This file contains another subroutine that solves for the government-centric equilibrium under optimal government policy for a given set of parameters.

- EqilGovF.m: This file contains another subroutine that solves for the fundamental-centric equilibrium under optimal government policy for a given set of parameters.

=====================================================================

All of these files are stored in the ./MatlabCode folder.

- PlotFigure1 outputs Figure1.fig and Figure1.eps which correspond to Figure 1 in the paper

- PlotFigure2 outputs Figure2.fig and Figure2.eps which correspond to Figure 2 in the paper

- PlotFigure3 outputs Figure3.fig and Figure3.eps which correspond to Figure 3 in the paper

- PlotFigure4 outputs Figure4.fig and Figure4.eps which correspond to Figure 4 in the paper
