Replication file for Demographics and Automation, 
by Acemoglu and Restrepo

Instructions:
1. Unzip this folder
2. To produce all tables and figures, run the executer "executer 6-28-2020.do"
located in the "dofiles" subfolder. You must change the global directory to indicate the location of the replication kit folder in your system.
3. All the programs and dofiles required are available on the "dofiles" subfolder.
4. To reporduce all our results, data from the International Federation of Robotics are required. In particular, the datasets "country_robot_flows" and "country_robot_stocks" are not made public. For information on how to obtain these data visit the International Federation of Robotics webpage. For dofiles to clean the IFR data, please email pascual@bu.edu.

Computational requirements: 
The dofiles were produced and run using Stata/MP v15.
