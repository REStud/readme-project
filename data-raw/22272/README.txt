
A. OVERVIEW
This folder contains the data and do-files that accompany the paper “The real effects of monetary expansions: evidence from a large-scale historical experiment” by Nuno Palma. The replication materials contain this README file; a "MASTER.do" file; two STATA dataset within the "data" folder ("liquidity.dta" and "datadescriptive.dta"); eleven do-files within the "dofiles" folder; an "output" folder for the Figures and tables generated using the dofiles; and an "additional_figs_tables" folder that contains one figure and two tables that are used in the paper but not generated using these dofiles. The do-file "MASTER.do" completes the analysis for the main body of the text by executing each of the eleven do-files that are necessary for the analysis. Each of the files can also be run separately through the "MASTER.do" file.  The replicator should expect the code for the "MASTER.do" to run for less than 10 minutes on a typical 2021 computer.  

B. DATA AVAILABILITY AND PROVENANCE STATEMENT:
The paper uses two types of data:

1) For outcomes and control variables, the data is available from the secondary literature and was either taken from publicly available websites where the authors deposited their data or given to the Author directly by the authors. GDP and prices come from the following sources: England from Broadberry et al. (2015), Holland from van Zanden and van Leeuwen (2012), Spain from Álvarez-Nogal and Prados de la Escosura (2013, 2017), Italy from Malanima (2011), Portugal from Palma and Reis (2019) and Germany from Pfister (2020). When the original price level was in silver it was transformed into monetary units using the information given by Karaman et al. (2020). Temperature data was made available to the Author by Noel Johnson, one of the authors of Anderson et al. (2017), who in turn rely on the Guiot and Corona (2010) dataset. The indicator about whether a country is at war with Spain is from Clodfelter (2008). The shipwrecks dataset is from Brzezinski et al. (2019). England’s nominal mint output from Challis (1992) and Palma (2018a,b). With regards to the innovation component of gold arrivals, it is built using Costa et al. (2013) and Morineau (2009) as explained in the text.

2) Data collected by the Author. With respect to the main causal variable, the data was collected from the printed information in TePaske (2010) and Jara (1963, 1966), following the procedure explained in detail in the paper. Gold kilograms were translated to silver using Barret (1990, p. 238).

C. STATEMENT ABOUT RIGHTS
The authors of the manuscript have legitimate access to and permission to use the data used in this manuscript.

D. DATASET LIST
The replication material consist of two datasets: "liquidity.dta" and "datadescriptive.dta". The sources for this data are described above in section B. of this README file and in the paper.

E. SOFTWARE REQUIREMENTS
The replication requires the use of STATA. The code was run using STATA/SE 16.  As noted in the dofile, two packages must be installed in order to run the "MASTER.do" file: labutil and estout. The code for installing this additional package is at the top of the dofile.

F. MEMORY AND APPROXIMATE RUNTIME REQUIREMENTS
The approximate time needed to reproduce the main analysis ("MASTER.do") using a standard 2021 computer is less than 10 minutes.

G. DESCRIPTION OF PROGRAMS
There is one master do-file "MASTER.do" (described in point G.1) and eleven main dofiles (described in G.2-G.12). 
For a full list of Figures and tables in order of appearance in the paper, see section H. of this README file.

G.1 MASTER.do
This do-file conducts the analysis for the paper (excluding the Online appendix). It first defines the directories and global macros used in the other files, including the main variables for the analysis and the robustness checks. It then links to all the other do-files and performs the analysis of these. This master file clearly explains what analysis is being conducted in each of the files that it links to. Each of the do-files that it links to is now listed below, in order of appearance in the MASTER.do file.

G.2 descriptive_figures.do 
This do-file produces figures 4, 5, 6, and 8 from section 2.3 of the paper and saves them in the "output" folder. 

G.3 descriptive_additionalfigures.do
This do-file produces figures 2, 3, 7, and 11, 12 and 17, located in different sections of the paper and saves them in the "output" folder. 

G.4 projections_main_1700.do
This do-file produces Figure 9 from section 3.1 of the paper and saves them in the "output" folder.

Results for Column 1 of Table 3 are saved as "Table3_Column1.log" in the "output" folder. The log-file contains two tables: the first output table in the log file entitled "First-stage regressions" gives the reported coefficient (first lag of "metals_prod_ship5y"), standard error, p-value, as well as its t-statistic. The F-statistic reported in Table 3 of the paper is the square of the t-statistic of metals_prod_ship5y in the log file.

The log-file contains two tables: the first output table in the log file entitled "First-stage regressions" gives the reported coefficient ("metals_prod_ship5y"), standard error, p-value, as well as its t-statistic. The F-statistic reported in Table 3 of the paper is the square of the t-statistic of metals_prod_ship5y in the log file. 

G.8 projections_EnglandIV_lag2_1700.do
This do-file produces the results for Table 3, column 3, in section 3.4.

This do-file produces the results for Table 3, column 4, in section 3.4.
Results for Column 4 of Table 3 are saved as "Table3_Column4.log" in the "output" folder. The log-file contains two tables: the first output table in the log file entitled "First-stage regressions" gives the reported coefficient (variable "metals_prod_ship5y"), standard error, p-value, as well as its t-statistic. The F-statistic reported in Table 3 of the paper  is the square of the t-statistic of metals_prod_ship5y in the log file.

H.2 TABLES ARE GENERATED BY THE FOLLOWING DO-FILES

Table 1: The information for this table is directly copied from the sources listed in the paper. Thus, this table is not generated within the code. The table can be found in the "additional_figs_tables" folder ("table1.tex").
Table 2: The information for this table is directly copied from the sources listed in the paper. Thus, this table is not generated within the code. The table can be found  in the "additional_figs_tables" folder ("table2.tex").
Table 3: The information for the columns ofthis table are generated separately in the files projections_EnglandIV_baseline_1700.do (Column 1), projections_EnglandIV_lag0_1700.do (Column 2), projections_EnglandIV_lag2_1700.do (Column 3), projections_EnglandIV_nocott_1700.do (Column 4), and projections_EnglandIV_3y_1700.do (Column 5). The information for each column is saved separately as "Table3_col1.log", Table3_col2.log", "Table3_col3.log", "Table3_col4.log" and "Table3_col5.log", respectively. 
Table 4: The information for this table is generated in projections_reversecausality_GDPIV_1700.do, saved as "Table4.log."

I. INSTRUCTIONS TO REPLICATORS:
The instructor should open the "MASTER.do" file and first change the directories there (or alternatively leave the default directories), as explained in the do-file. Then, the replicator should run the "MASTER.do" file to produce all figures as well as the information required for the tables. By default, the figures will be produced in the folder where the datasets are located, but the replicator can change this at the top of the "MASTER.do" file, as is clearly explained in the file. If desired, the replicator can also separately run each code segment from the "MASTER.do" file.
