## Dataset loop
1. Short canonical name of dataset
2. Are you including it in the package? If not, why not?
3. Is it publicly available? If not, why not?
4. Organization creating or publishing the dataset.
5. Official name of dataset, in original language.
6. Date of publication.
7. Resource locators like URL or DOI.
8. Date of access.
9. Describe the conditions of access. Free text.
10. We created the following citation for you. Please edit if anything is incorrect.

Repeat until no more datasets. Explicitly confirm "no other external data source is used in the paper".
